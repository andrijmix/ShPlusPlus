/* TODO:
Your task is to write a method:

private double raiseToPower(double base, int exponent)

This method will take two parameters and calculate the value of the first parameter raised to the power of parameter
2. i.e. raiseToPower(2.0, 3) will give 2^3 = 8 The second parameter can be not only positive, but also negative.
For example, 0.5 to the power of -2 is 4. To simplify your life, let's assume that everything raised to the power of 0
 will become 1, that is, 0 to the power of 0 will be 1 ðŸ˜ƒ

Since double cannot store infinitely long fractional numbers (as we discussed), all kinds of small errors are possible
when manipulating doubles. This is ok.

Also, you're not allowed to use Math.pow, Math.exp, Math.log and other convenient methods from Math in this subtask,
otherwise what's the point of writing one method, right? ðŸ˜ƒ
